# Welcome to ZhoJcc's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
Hey, Iâ€™m Joe, but you can call me Zho! I've been coding as a hobby (basic things) for a few years, but now Iâ€™m finally taking it seriously and working towards a career in software engineering. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science, and Iâ€™m excited to share my journey and projects here.

### What You'll Find Here
This GitHub is dedicated to my school work and personal learning projects. Youâ€™ll see class assignments, projects from my Python, HTML, and CSS classes, and as I progress, more advanced projects as I explore new technologies like AI and machine learning.

### Learning Goals
Iâ€™m focused on expanding my skill set by learning new technologies, honing my coding abilities, and figuring out how to grow both academically and professionally. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer and work on innovative solutions.

### Current Focus
- Python class projects
- HTML & CSS assignments
- Personal projects to deepen my understanding

### Collaboration
I'm open to collaborating on projects, so feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in working together!

### Contact Info
More to come soon! My website will be available at [zho.codes](http://zho.codes) in the future, where I'll share more about my work and how to get in touch.
